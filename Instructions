Instructions for Running the Python Script
1. Approach to the Solution
Data Extraction:
●	Input Reading:
●	Read URLs from Input.xlsx.
●	Place Input.xlsx in C:\\Users\\admin\\Downloads\\.
●	Place PositiveWords.txt and NegativeWords.txt in the same directory.
●	Make sure to update your file path in the code accordingly.
●	Text Extraction:
●	Fetch webpage content using GET requests.
●	Parse HTML with BeautifulSoup to extract text within <p> tags.
●	Saving Extracted Text:
●	Save the text to files named by URL_ID.
●	Text Analysis:
●	Sentiment and Readability Analysis:
●	Tokenize text into sentences and words.
●	Calculate sentiment scores using predefined positive and negative word lists.
●	Perform readability analysis with metrics like average sentence length and Gunning Fog Index.
●	Loading Word Lists:
●	Load positive and negative words from local files, excluding common stop words.
●	Storing Results:
●	Save computed metrics to output.xlsx.
●	Text files for each URL will be created in the working directory.
●	output.xlsx with metrics will be generated.

2. How to Run the python script?
Prerequisites:
●	Python 3.12 installed.
●	Use VS code to open the file 
●	Import Required libraries: pandas, requests, beautifulsoup4, nltk, textblob, and openpyxl.
●	Use pip command for downloading the libraries to successfully import libraries.
●	In the terminal run the python file (main.py), type the following : python main.py	

3. Dependencies Required
●	pandas: For reading the input Excel file and creating the output Excel file.
●	requests: For sending HTTP requests to fetch webpage content.
●	BeautifulSoup (bs4): For parsing HTML and extracting text.
●	nltk: For text tokenization and stop words.
●	textblob: For additional text processing (although not explicitly used in the given script).
●	openpyxl: For reading from and writing to Excel files.
